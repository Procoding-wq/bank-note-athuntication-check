Bank Note Authentication using TensorFlow

This project focuses on classifying banknotes as authentic or counterfeit using a Deep Learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used for training and testing comes directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, known as the Banknote Authentication Dataset. It contains statistical features extracted from images of genuine and forged banknotes. These features include the variance, skewness, curtosis (kurtosis), and entropy of the wavelet-transformed image. Each record also contains a target class label, where 0 represents an authentic note and 1 represents a fake one.

The model is a simple Sequential Neural Network that consists of three fully connected layers. The first layer has 16 neurons with a ReLU activation function, followed by an 8-neuron ReLU layer, and a final output layer with a single neuron using the sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and the binary crossentropy loss function, with accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.

The project follows a structured workflow: it begins by downloading and loading the dataset directly from the UCI repository, converting it into a pandas DataFrame, and then preprocessing the data using the StandardScaler to standardize the features. The data is divided into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio. After that, the model is trained for 20 epochs with a validation split of 20%. During training, both the training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the learning progress.

Once trained, the model is evaluated on the test data, producing metrics such as overall accuracy, confusion matrix, and a detailed classification report that includes precision, recall, and F1-score. In testing, the model consistently achieves over 99% accuracy, correctly identifying both authentic and fake notes. A sample prediction is also demonstrated using manually entered feature values to verify model performance, outputting both a prediction score and the final class label ‚Äî indicating whether the note is ‚ÄúAuthentic üè¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúFake üíµ‚Äù.

To run this project, you need Python 3.8 or later and must install the required dependencies such as TensorFlow, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and requests. After installing these libraries, simply run the Python script bank_note_classification_tensorflow.py. It will display the training graphs, evaluation metrics, and final prediction output.

In the future, this project can be extended by integrating a user-friendly desktop or web interface, allowing users to input note features and instantly check authenticity. Additional improvements could include image-based feature extraction using OpenCV and deploying the model as a live prediction service using Flask or Streamlit.
